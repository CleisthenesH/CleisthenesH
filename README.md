### Hello ðŸ‘‹

# Introduction
I am a software engineer working on the Australian east coast.
I also have a deep interest in mathematics, completing a degree, where I developed a love of typesetting along side mathematics and programming.
These interests are incorporated into making accompanying documents for many of my programming pursuit.

# :goat: YALE :goat:

The Yale is a mythical goat like creature with an additional pair of tusks and horns that can swivel around.

I just think they're neat and have adopted this one in particular as my avatar.
#  Repos Summary :octocat:
## Main
At the time of writing I have three main repos.
1. :goat: [Yet Another Lua Engine](https://github.com/CleisthenesH/YALE) is a GUI widget engine and whose abbreviation is where I get my avatar from.
2. :lock: [Rijndael-Field-Hashing](https://github.com/CleisthenesH/Rijndael-Field-Hashing) is the application and pedagogical documentation of finite field theory to hashing.
3. :brain: [Neural-Networks](https://github.com/CleisthenesH/Neural-Networks) is the same as Rijndael but with Neural Networks.
4. :heavy_plus_sign: [Math-Notes](https://github.com/CleisthenesH/Math-Notes) is a collection living math documents (permanently unfinished) that detail stuff I found interesting enough to write down.

Other repos exist at various levels of completion and commitment on my end.
